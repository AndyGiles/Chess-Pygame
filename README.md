# Chess-Pygame
A chess game for 2 players using Python's 2d Graphics module Pygame.

To use, put chess.py in the same folder as pawn.png, knight.png, rook.png, bishop.png, queen.png, and king.png, and run chess.py. You will need to have pygame downloaded.

The purple player will go first. Click pieces to select them, and then click on another square to move the piece to that location.

Once a piece is selected, green squares represent empty spaces to move to, and red squares mark enemy pieces you can capture.
